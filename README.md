### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rosie, I'm a software developer living in London. I'm a full stack developer with experience in front-end, back-end and app development. Some technologies I enjoy working with are React, Java, Kotlin and React Native.

Outside of work I love to sew, and make clothes that are made just for me.
